        <p>When I was young I remember stumbling across a simple website that would randomly give a silly insult. Showing this website to my friends we turned it into an inside joke. If anyone of us became upset we would blurt out an insult we remembered seeing on that website. Now as an adult I thought it would be a fun project to recreate a childhood meme.</p>
